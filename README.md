This is a modified version of the KarelTheRobot project created by askingalot (See https://github.com/askingalot/KarelTheRobot)

These adjustments bring the robot closer to the implementation in Stanford's CS106a course. I've added the homework assignments from that course and also simplified the interface for selecting a world for the people I'm teaching using this tool.
